      <p>The staples that I could happily live out the rest of my days eating only these. These are available everyone in China,</p>

<h3>
<a id="baozi-包子" class="anchor" href="#baozi-%E5%8C%85%E5%AD%90" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Baozi 包子</h3>

<p>Super tasty awesome steamed buns, these are just great. Fillings range from savoury to sweet, minced porks in usually the most common. They are a very common as a breakfast in China, and you can find bun cafes which only serve these, with stacks of bamboo steamers containing hundreds of buns lining the cafe walls,</p>

<p>Buns are cooked are circular bamboo steams so whenever you see these you know that baozi heaven is only a moment away, these range in size from single portion size, to large steamers capable of holding 30 or so buns;</p>

<p>Also very common to see them being served on the street, or you can usually pick one up at a time of the day from a Seven-Eleven (they're not nearly as good though obviously)</p>

<p>In Cantonese food (Hong Kong) the common bun is called <em>Cha siu bao</em> and has a filling of sticky barbecued pork. Cha siu bao have a slightly different texture from the baozi you will find on the mainland.</p>

<h3>
<a id="jaozi--饺子" class="anchor" href="#jaozi--%E9%A5%BA%E5%AD%90" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Jaozi ~ 饺子</h3>

<p>Chinese dumplings, these taste similiar to japanese dumplings (gaozi in japanese) and like Baozi's can contain a wide range of fillings, however the most common is minced pork.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiaozi">Wikipedia</a></p>

<p>You can generally get dumplings in most chinese restaurants at any time of the day or night, however the best dumplings are generally to be found in the small dingy cafes resembling someones living room. These cafes generally specialise in dumplings and serve nothing else. Find yourself a dumpling cafe if you can and order yourself one plate of steamed jaozi - 蒸餃 zhēngjiǎo, one plate of boiled jaozi - shuǐjiǎo 水餃, and one plate fried -  鍋貼 guōtiē (my personal favourite). Sheer dumpling heaven. </p>

<p>Dumpling cafes generally have some dumplings on display at the front so hopefully quite easy to find, and usually overflowing with steam from all tasty dumplings (especially on cold mornings, where the resemble something like the world's tastiest sauna)</p>

<a id="lamian--拉面" class="anchor" href="#lamian--%E6%8B%89%E9%9D%A2" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Lamian ~ 拉面</h3>

<p>The most awesomely delicious noodles, hand stretched before being fried or served in soup, these come from the muslim group in China which are primarily based in the west of the country, but I found small cafes selling Lamian noodles all over China. </p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Islamic_cuisine#Lamian">Wikipedia</a></p>

<p>Keep on the look out for people throwing balls of dough into the air and stretching them outside small cafes. Also most muslims in China generally wear small round hats,</p>

<p>Pronounciation: I seem to remember it's roughly like 'lam-Yen'</p>
